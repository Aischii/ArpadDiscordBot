Of course it's a welcome message you dumb.\n\nI hope your enjoy being in this server, basically it's like other server, a place to communicate with other people, and a place for you that enjoy my content. Have fun exploring if there's something to explore.\n\nDon't forget to check the rules on <#972906572017696828>, but I don't think you're going to see it, even this text as well.\n\nAnyway, the last message is just tagging you {{user_mention}}, and after this there's nothing.\n\nNah I'm lying, use this link if you want to invite your friends here https://discord.gg/9KxAsanBWa. Thank you for joining and reading this until the end.",
